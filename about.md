 I'm on my way to become a full-stack web developer.

My interest lies from the front end to the back end, from the code to the design, from the beauty of arts to the logic of science, from the photography to all kinds of sports and everything in between.

Jekyll combined with github page is an elegant design for developers to host projects. I guess I'm going to make this site flourish step by step.
